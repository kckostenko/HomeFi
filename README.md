# HomeFi

This project was created and designed to provide a live web application to control a smart
  home network. This was done by use of the Django framework as the backend and HTML, CSS,
  and JavaScript as the frontend. This project was, and is still, hosted on goDaddy, and 
  is managed by use of cPanel. In addition, a relational database was designed and connected
  using the MySQL database management system to manage users and their network devices.
